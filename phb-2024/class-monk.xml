			<h4>A Martial Artist of Supernatural Focus</h4>
			<p>Monks use rigorous combat training and mental discipline to align themselves with the multiverse and focus their internal reservoirs of power. Different Monks conceptualize this power in various ways: as breath, energy, life force, essence, or self, for example. Whether channeled as a striking display of martial prowessor as a subtler manifestation of defense and speed, this power infuses all that a Monk does.</p>
			<p class="indent">Monks focus their internal power to create extraordinary, even supernatural, effects. They channel uncanny speed and strength into their attacks, with or without the use of weapons. In a Monk's hands, even the most basic weapons can become sophisticated implements of combat mastery.</p>
			<p class="indent">Many Monks find that a structured life of ascetic withdrawal helps them cultivate the physical and mental focus they need to harness their power. Other Monks believe that immersing themselves in the vibrant confusion of life helps to fuel their determination and discipline.</p>
			<p class="indent">Monks generally view adventures as tests of their physical and mental development. They are driven by a desire to accomplish a greater mission thanmerely slaying monsters and plundering treasure; they strive to turn themselves into living weapons.</p>
